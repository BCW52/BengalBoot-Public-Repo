# BengalBoot Project Licensing Terms

## Overview

This document outlines the licensing terms for code, artwork, and other contributions to the **BengalBoot Project**. By contributing to this project, you agree to these terms to ensure community collaboration and user safety.

## 1. Dual Licensing Structure

**Project Bengal** employs a dual licensing model. Contributions may fall under two licensing regimes:

- **Open Source License**: Contributions may be licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)**.
- **Proprietary License**: Some contributions may be designated as proprietary to maintain confidentiality and restrict distribution.

This dual approach protects sensitive code while allowing for collaboration on open-source components.

## 2. Code Contributions

### 2.1 Open Source Contributions

All code contributions intended for public release will be licensed under the **GPL-3.0**. This ensures:

- The code remains free and open-source.
- Any derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL-3.0.

### 2.2 Proprietary Contributions

**Project Bengal** reserves the right to designate specific modules or contributions as proprietary, allowing for:

- **Fully Open**: Available under GPL-3.0.
- **Partially Open**: Some portions restricted for security or proprietary reasons.
- **Private**: Certain code may be confidential for safety and integrity.

Proper credit will always be given to original authors, regardless of licensing status.

### 2.3 Contributor Agreement

By contributing code, you agree that:

- You are the original author of the code.
- Your contribution does not infringe on third-party intellectual property rights.
- You grant **Project Bengal** the right to license your contributions under both the GPL-3.0 and a proprietary license.
- You will retain attribution for your contributions even if licensing changes.

## 3. Artwork Contributions

### 3.1 Licensing

Artwork contributions (icons, logos, themes, etc.) will initially be licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)**. This license allows others to share and adapt your work with proper attribution.

### 3.2 Contributor Agreement

By contributing artwork, you agree that:

- You are the original creator of the artwork.
- Your contribution complies with relevant intellectual property laws.
- You grant **Project Bengal** the right to change the licensing if necessary.

All artwork contributors will receive proper credit regardless of licensing changes.

## 4. License Attribution

- Code contributions will follow the [GPL-3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
- Artwork contributions will follow the [CC BY-SA 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## 5. License Changes

**Project Bengal** reserves the right to amend these licensing terms to address security, legal, or operational concerns. Changes will be documented and communicated to the community, and contributors will continue to receive proper credit.
